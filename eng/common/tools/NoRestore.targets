  <!--
    Set this file as property NuGetRestoreTargets to avoid msbuild attempting a restore in static graph mode.
    It probes for _IsProjectRestoreSupported to determine whether restore should be performed, rather than evaluating
    the target, because it assumes that this target will always return true.
