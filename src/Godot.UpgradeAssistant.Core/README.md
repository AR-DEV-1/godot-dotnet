# Godot .NET upgrade assistant (Core)

Core library for the Godot .NET upgrade assistant. This contains the common types that are used by the [CLI tool](../Godot.UpgradeAssistant.Cli) to perform an upgrade, and by the [Godot.UpgradeAssistant.Providers](../Godot.UpgradeAssistant.Providers) to implement the analyzers and upgraders that will be used to perform said upgrade.

The Godot .NET upgrade assistant is heavily inspired by the [.NET upgrade assistant](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant).
