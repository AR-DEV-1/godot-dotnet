# Godot.EditorIntegration

Tooling to enhance the experience of using the .NET bindings from the Godot editor. This includes editor plugins that automatically build the .NET project that is part of a Godot project, and publishes the .NET project to be included in an exported Godot project.

This package should not be referenced directly by users, it will be retrieved on-demand by the Godot editor.
