# Godot.BindingsGenerator.Reflection

Types that define C# types and members. These types try to follow closely the [`System.Reflection`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.reflection) and [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) APIs. They are used to define the C# types that will be generated by [Godot.BindingsGenerator](../Godot.BindingsGenerator).
