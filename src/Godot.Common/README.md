# Godot.Common

This project contains shared helpers, utilities, or extensions that are used across multiple projects.

This is a general project that shouldn't require any additional dependencies. More specific utils can be included in a more specific project (like [Godot.Common.CodeAnalysis](../Godot.Common.CodeAnalysis) which contains utils specific to the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.*` packages).
