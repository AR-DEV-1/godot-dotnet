# Godot.SourceGenerators (enums)

This directory contains enums that mirror those defined in the [`Godot.Bindings`](../../Godot.Bindings). These enums are used by the source generators to retrieve the values from the analyzed source code, and to write generated code, so their values must be kept in sync with the values in the bindings to prevent issues. A comment at the top of each file indicates the path of the original file that the enum was copied from.
